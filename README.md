# CORTANA
A voice controlled assistant for python users. Every individual class is another program to use and each program will be grouped into
operating system sections.

Currently on Pre-Alpha, CORTANA only knows 3 commands which are open, weather and conversations.
It only works on macs but will detect all of your applications in the applications folder and allows you to open any of them using your voice. It also will listen for the word "thanks" and then shut down. It will also display the current weather in the czech republic which is customizable in the code, however you will have to have a knowledge of how the module works to use it. Finally there is some basic converation implemented (ALTHOUGHT ITS UNTESTED) and has a few commands you can find in the code to explore.
