# CORTANA
A voice controlled assistant for python users. Every individual class is another program to use and each program will be grouped into
operating system sections.

Currently on Pre-Alpha, CORTANA only knows 1 command which is open.
It only works on macs but will detect all of your applications in the applications folder and allows you to open any of them using your voice. It also will listen for the word "thanks" and then shut down.
